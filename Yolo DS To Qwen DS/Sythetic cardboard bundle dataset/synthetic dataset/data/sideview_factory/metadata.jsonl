Only thin horizontal stripe edges visible. Industrial documentary photograph from a fixed factory camera of a pallet of corrugated cardboard blanks\nmoving slowly on a roller conveyor from right to left. Camera geometry: strict side view (fronto-parallel). Optical axis is perpendicular to the pallet face. Yaw = 0°. Pitch and roll ≈ 0°. Vertical edges are plumb and parallel to image borders; no visible top plane; only the long side face is visible.\nCamera pitch -0.7°, roll 0.34°.
